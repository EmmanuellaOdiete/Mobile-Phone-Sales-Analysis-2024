# üì± Mobile-Phone-Sales-Analysis-2024
This project is my submission for the **Onyx Data DNA Challenge - May 2025**. The challenge involved analyzing mobile phone sales data from 2024 to uncover insights about product performance, customer behavior, sales channels, and regional trends. The final output is an interactive Power BI dashboard and technical report.

## üéØ Objectives
The key goals of this analysis were to:
- Identify best-selling mobile brands and models by units and revenue.
- Understand how features like storage, color, and operating system influence buying behavior.
- Analyze customer demographics (age and gender) in relation to brand affinity.
- Evaluate the performance of different sales channels and payment methods.
- Examine regional sales patterns across cities and countries.
- Detect month-over-month sales trends and seasonal fluctuations.

## üìÇ Access the Dataset

## üí° Final Thoughts
This project highlights the power of data storytelling using Power BI to extract actionable insights from complex sales data. While limited by the absence of cost and customer satisfaction metrics, it provides a robust foundation for strategic decisions in marketing, inventory, and customer engagement.
